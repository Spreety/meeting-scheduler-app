# meeting-scheduler-app
This is an app for scheduling meetings.

**Title:** Scheduling App

**Description:**
The purpose of this app is to provide a meeting scheduling system. It allows the user to schedule, update, and cancel meetings. 
The user has the ability to view upcoming meetings for the week or month, as well as all scheduled meetings. The app also allows 
the user to add, update, and delete employees. Reports are able to be generated that show either employee appointment totals, 
employees by Country, or employee schedules.
